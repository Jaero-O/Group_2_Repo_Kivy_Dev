        "We are a team of innovators dedicated to integrating technology with agriculture to support "
        "smarter and more sustainable farming practices. Our focus is on developing practical solutions "
        "that empower users to monitor plant health efficiently using affordable and portable tools designed "
        "for real-world agricultural environments.\n\n"
        "The mango leaf scanning and detection system represents our commitment to bridging the gap between "
        "modern computing and traditional farming. By utilizing image processing and machine learning on "
        "accessible hardware like the Raspberry Pi, we aim to simplify disease detection and make precision "
        "agriculture achievable at every level.\n\n"
        "Our development process emphasizes research, experimentation, and user-centered design. We continuously "
        "test and refine our system to ensure reliability, usability, and scalability, enabling farmers, researchers, "
        "and agricultural organizations to benefit from accurate and actionable data.\n\n"
        "Beyond disease detection, our goal is to contribute to agricultural data collection and analysis by turning "
        "every scan into valuable information. Through ongoing innovation, we strive to build a foundation for broader "
        "agricultural intelligence that supports productivity, sustainability, and environmental balance.\n\n"
        "We believe that the future of agriculture lies in combining scientific insight with technological advancement. "
        "Our team remains dedicated to improving tools and systems that help farmers make informed decisions, protect "
        "their crops, and promote a healthier agricultural ecosystem."
