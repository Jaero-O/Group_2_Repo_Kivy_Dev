        "Overview:\n"
        "Anthracnose is one of the most common fungal diseases affecting mango trees, "
        "caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. It primarily targets young leaves, "
        "flowers, and fruits, reducing both yield and fruit quality.\n\n"
        "Symptoms on Leaves:\n"
        "• Small, dark brown to black spots that may expand and merge over time\n"
        "• Irregularly shaped lesions often surrounded by a yellow halo\n"
        "• Premature leaf drop in severe infections\n"
        "• In humid conditions, pinkish spore masses may appear on infected areas\n\n"
        "Causes:\n"
        "• Warm, humid, and rainy environments favor fungal growth\n"
        "• Poor air circulation around dense canopies\n"
        "• Contaminated tools or infected plant debris\n\n"
        "Prevention and Management:\n"
        "• Regularly prune trees to improve air circulation\n"
        "• Avoid overhead irrigation to minimize leaf wetness\n"
        "• Apply recommended fungicides during early growth stages\n"
        "• Remove and dispose of infected leaves and plant material\n\n"
        "Note:\n"
        "Early detection and proper management are crucial to preventing the spread of "
        "anthracnose and maintaining healthy mango production."
